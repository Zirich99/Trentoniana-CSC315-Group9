    <!-- About us description -->
        <p>
            As the initial Trentoniana archive has audio and 
            transcript files saved in one directory, our goal is 
            to create a simple user-friendly interface that
            allows a more organized view of these saved files.
            The audio and transcript files are accessible to the 
            user by searching or sorting from a drop down. It is 
            important for us to allow the user to view these
            recordings that provide rich history of the local area 
            wiith easy access and quick performance from the system.
            Our web application also allows those with more access to
            have the ability to insert and delete files.
